-PROBLEM: So here are the issues I am having, when I create a video completely, then press back, and create a new video,
 it completely does not work, ? lets review the back button, I still see a temp audio created, maybe thats the problem 
-SOLTUION: Reset the VideoPlayer mixpython library, then delete the tempaudio.wav

-PROBLEM: The scrollable frame in VideoEditor back button doesnt reset the scroll to the right orientation / coordinates
-SOLUTION: look in the scrollable frame custom tkiner and find the function that will reset it.
